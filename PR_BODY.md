# Update README: Chat‑first platform overview

## Summary
This PR rewrites the README to be developer‑first and product‑led. It leads with Chat, clarifies Managed vs Embedded agents, and explains the xpander.ai platform (Chat, Workbench, AgentOS, Connector Hub, AI Tools). It also fixes typos and adds screenshots.

## Key changes
- Chat‑first intro and Getting Started flow
- Managed (serverless) vs Embedded (container) with switch instructions
- Access paths: Chat, Webhook, SDK, A2A, MCP
- Platform at a glance: Chat, Workbench (Starter Kit + tool menu), AgentOS (task scheduler), Connector Hub, AI Tools
- Added screenshots: Workbench and Chat generalist agent
- Typos/grammar fixes; consistent terminology

## Screenshots
- Workbench: images/workbench.png
- Chat generalist: images/generalist-agent.png

## Notes
- Intentional: README and images only. Other modified/untracked files are left out of this PR.
- After merge, we can replace <VIDEO> placeholders when assets are ready.
